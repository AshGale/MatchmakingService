      "taskTitle": "Setup Docker Environment",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Docker environment setup task into detailed subtasks covering installation, configuration of each service (Node.js, PostgreSQL, Caddy), networking, volume management, environment variable handling, and testing on Windows 10.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple components (Docker, Docker Compose, three services) with complex configuration requirements. The Windows-specific setup adds complexity, as does the need for proper networking, volume persistence, and security configuration. The existing subtasks cover the basics but miss Windows-specific troubleshooting and environment variable security."
