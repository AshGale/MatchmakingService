      "complexityScore": 7,

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the README.md creation into granular subtasks for each major section (Overview, Prerequisites, Installation, Environment Configuration, Database Setup, Running the Application, API Documentation, Testing, Deployment, Contributing, Table of Contents, and Final Review). For each, specify the expected content, formatting requirements, and validation steps.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive README.md is moderately complex due to the breadth of required sections, the need for technical accuracy, and the importance of clarity and completeness. Each section (overview, setup, configuration, deployment, etc.) requires careful documentation, tested commands, and cross-referencing with the codebase and other docs. Best practices recommend detailed, well-structured, and regularly updated documentation[1][2][4]. The task is already partially broken down, but further granularity (e.g., splitting API docs, testing, and deployment into separate subtasks) will improve quality and maintainability."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the startup script task into subtasks for: (1) cross-platform script scaffolding, (2) prerequisite checking, (3) database initialization, (4) backend setup, (5) frontend setup, (6) error handling and messaging, (7) CLI argument parsing and help, (8) process management and cleanup, and (9) integration and documentation updates. For each, define expected behaviors, edge cases, and testing requirements.",
      "reasoning": "Developing a unified, cross-platform startup script is complex due to the need for robust prerequisite checks, database management, dependency handling, process orchestration, error handling, and user-friendly CLI options. Ensuring compatibility across Unix and Windows, handling various failure scenarios, and integrating with documentation adds to the challenge. Each major function (prerequisite checks, DB setup, backend/frontend orchestration, CLI, process management) warrants its own subtask for clarity and testability."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the guide creation into subtasks for: (1) compiling all environment variables from the codebase, (2) documenting variables by component, (3) drafting the .env setup walkthrough, (4) writing environment-specific configuration instructions, (5) documenting validation tools and troubleshooting, (6) cross-referencing with other docs, and (7) peer review and revision. For each, specify the expected output and review criteria.",
      "reasoning": "Documenting environment variables is moderately complex, requiring thorough codebase review, clear explanations, and structured presentation. The guide must be comprehensive, accurate, and accessible to developers of all levels. Including validation tools, troubleshooting, and integration with other documentation increases the scope. Breaking the work into focused subtasks ensures completeness and consistency."
