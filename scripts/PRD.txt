# Refined Matchmaking Service Product Requirements Document
*Optimized for Independent Development and Clean Integration*

## 1. Introduction

This refined PRD restructures the matchmaking service development to emphasize **separation of concerns** and **independent development workflows**. Each layer can be developed, tested, and validated in isolation before integration points are established. This approach reduces dependencies, enables parallel development, and ensures robust system architecture.

## 2. Development approach philosophy

### 2.1 Independent layer development
Each system layer (Database, Backend API, Frontend Components, API Client) will be developed as standalone modules with clearly defined interfaces and mock dependencies. This enables:
- Parallel development by different team members
- Independent testing and validation
- Reduced coupling and increased maintainability
- Clear integration contracts between layers

### 2.2 Integration-focused design
After independent layer completion, specific integration tasks will connect the components using well-defined interfaces. Integration tasks focus solely on connecting working parts rather than building functionality.

## 3. Phase 1: Independent layer development

## 6. Development workflow and dependencies

### 6.1 Parallel development approach
1. **Week 1-2**: All four independent layers developed simultaneously by different developers
2. **Week 3**: Integration layer development begins after all independent layers are complete
3. **Week 4**: End-to-end integration and comprehensive testing

### 6.2 Quality gates
Each independent layer must pass:
- Complete unit test coverage (>90%)
- Code review and approval
- Documentation completion
- Mock/simulation testing validation

Integration phases require:
- Integration test suite passing
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security review completion
- User acceptance testing approval

### 6.3 Risk mitigation
- **Interface contracts**: Clearly defined APIs between layers prevent integration issues
- **Mock implementations**: Allow development to continue even if dependencies are blocked
- **Incremental integration**: Gradual connection of components reduces integration complexity
- **Rollback capability**: Each integration step can be reverted if issues arise

This refined approach ensures robust, maintainable code while enabling efficient parallel development and reducing integration risks.
