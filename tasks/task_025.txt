# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement database persistence for lobby data
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the PostgreSQL database with the lobby system to ensure data is properly persisted
# Details:
The application currently does not persist lobby data between restarts. 

1. Connect to the PostgreSQL database using the existing schema.sql design
2. Update the lobby-manager.js to use database queries instead of in-memory storage
