# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Database Connection Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create database connection and configuration management utilities with connection pooling and transaction handling.
# Details:
Implement a database connection management module with:

1. Connection Pool Configuration:
   - Configure connection pool size (min: 5, max: 20)
   - Set connection timeout (5 seconds)
   - Set idle timeout (60 seconds)
   - Implement connection validation

2. Transaction Handling:
   - Create transaction wrapper function
   - Implement automatic rollback on errors
   - Support nested transactions if needed

3. Error Handling:
   - Create custom database error types
   - Map database errors to application errors
   - Implement retry logic for transient errors

4. Health Check:
   - Create database health check function
   - Monitor connection pool metrics

Use appropriate database driver and connection pooling library based on the database system (e.g., pg-pool for PostgreSQL).

# Test Strategy:
Test the connection management with:
- Connection acquisition under normal load
- Connection timeout scenarios
- Pool exhaustion handling
- Transaction commit/rollback scenarios
- Error propagation and handling
- Connection leak detection
- Performance under concurrent connections

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Connection Pool [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and tune the database connection pool to efficiently manage and reuse database connections, optimizing for performance and resource usage.
### Details:
Define pool size, timeout settings, and connection validation parameters. Ensure the pool is appropriate for the expected workload and database limits.

## 2. Implement Transaction Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Design and implement mechanisms for managing database transactions to ensure data consistency and integrity.
### Details:
Establish transaction boundaries, support commit and rollback operations, and ensure transactions are properly managed within pooled connections.

## 3. Develop Error Handling Strategy [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create robust error handling for database operations, including connection failures, transaction errors, and pool exhaustion scenarios.
### Details:
Implement retry logic, logging, and escalation procedures for critical failures. Ensure errors are handled gracefully to maintain application stability.

## 4. Implement Health Check Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Set up health checks to monitor the status of database connections and the connection pool, enabling proactive detection of issues.
### Details:
Integrate periodic connection validation, pool status monitoring, and alerting for unhealthy states. Ensure health checks are lightweight and do not impact performance.
