# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement HTTP Client Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a configurable HTTP client with interceptors, timeout handling, and retry logic.
# Details:
Implement an HTTP client configuration with:

1. Base configuration:
   - Base URL from environment variables
   - Default headers (Content-Type, Accept)
   - Default timeout (5 seconds)
   - Response type configuration

2. Request/response interceptors:
   - Request interceptor for authentication headers
   - Response interceptor for error handling
   - Response data transformation

3. Timeout configuration:
   - Default timeout: 5 seconds
   - Long operation timeout: 30 seconds
   - Custom timeout per request type

4. Retry logic:
   - 3 retry attempts for network failures
   - Exponential backoff (starting at 300ms)
   - Configurable retry conditions
   - Maximum retry delay (5 seconds)

Use Axios or Fetch API with appropriate wrapper for consistent interface.

# Test Strategy:
Test the HTTP client with:
- Configuration tests for different environments
- Interceptor functionality tests
- Timeout handling tests
- Retry logic tests with mock failures
- Error transformation tests
- Mock server response tests
- Performance tests for concurrent requests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Base HTTP Client Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the core HTTP client with essential configuration parameters
### Details:
Create the base HTTP client configuration including base URL, default headers, serialization/deserialization settings, and connection pool settings. Document the configuration options and their default values.

## 2. Develop Request/Response Interceptors [done]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Implement interceptors to process requests and responses
### Details:
Create interceptors for common tasks such as authentication token injection, request logging, response validation, and error transformation. Ensure interceptors are modular and can be conditionally applied based on request characteristics.

## 3. Configure Timeout Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Implement connection, read, and write timeout configurations
### Details:
Set up appropriate timeout values for connection establishment, request writing, and response reading. Implement custom exception handling for timeout scenarios and provide clear error messages. Create configuration options to adjust timeouts based on endpoint characteristics.

## 4. Implement Retry Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.3
### Description: Add retry capabilities for transient failures
### Details:
Develop a retry mechanism with configurable policies including max attempts, backoff strategy, and retry-eligible error conditions. Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent overwhelming failing services. Add metrics collection for retry attempts and success rates.
