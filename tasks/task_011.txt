# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement API Middleware Stack
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive middleware stack for the API including validation, error handling, CORS, and logging.
# Details:
Implement the following middleware components:

1. Request Validation Middleware:
   - Use a schema validation library (e.g., Joi, Zod, Yup)
   - Create validation schemas for all endpoints
   - Return standardized validation error responses

2. Error Handling Middleware:
   - Create centralized error handler
   - Map different error types to appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Standardize error response format: `{error: string, details?: any}`
   - Include stack traces in development mode only

3. CORS Middleware:
   - Configure allowed origins based on environment
   - Set appropriate headers (Access-Control-Allow-*)
   - Handle preflight requests
   - Set secure options for credentials

4. Logging Middleware:
   - Log request method, path, and query parameters
   - Log response status code and timing
   - Mask sensitive data in logs
   - Use appropriate log levels (info, warn, error)
   - Configure different logging for development/production

Ensure middleware is applied in the correct order.

# Test Strategy:
Test middleware with:
- Requests that trigger each middleware component
- Invalid requests to test validation middleware
- Errors at different levels to test error handling
- Cross-origin requests to test CORS
- Verify logs contain appropriate information
- Test middleware order by checking execution sequence

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Request Validation Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create middleware to validate incoming API requests against defined schemas
### Details:
Develop a middleware that validates request bodies, query parameters, and URL parameters against predefined schemas. Use a validation library like Joi or Yup. Implement validation error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. Include type checking and required field validation.

## 2. Implement Error Handling Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a centralized error handling middleware to catch and process all API errors
### Details:
Develop middleware that catches errors from all routes and other middleware. Implement different handling for various error types (validation errors, authentication errors, server errors, etc.). Create standardized error response format with appropriate HTTP status codes. Add support for custom error classes and error logging.

## 3. Implement CORS Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware to control API access from different domains
### Details:
Configure CORS middleware with appropriate settings for allowed origins, methods, headers, and credentials. Implement different CORS rules for development and production environments. Test CORS configuration with cross-domain requests. Handle preflight requests correctly.

## 4. Implement Logging Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Create middleware to log all API requests and responses
### Details:
Develop middleware that logs request details (method, URL, headers, body) and response details (status code, response time, size). Implement different log levels (info, warn, error). Add request ID generation for request tracking. Configure log rotation and storage. Ensure sensitive data is not logged (passwords, tokens, etc.).
