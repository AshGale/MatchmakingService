# Description: Create a form component for creating new lobbies with player count selection and validation.
# Details:
Implement the CreateLobbyForm component with:

1. Props interface:
   ```typescript
   interface CreateLobbyFormProps {
     onSubmit: (maxPlayers: number) => void;
     loading?: boolean;
     error?: string;
   }
   ```

2. Form elements:
   - Player count selection (radio buttons or dropdown)
   - Options for 2, 3, and 4 players
   - Submit button with loading state
   - Error message display

3. Form validation:
   - Ensure player count is selected
   - Validate range (2-4)

4. States:
   - Initial state
   - Loading state during submission
   - Error state with message
   - Success state with reset

5. Accessibility:
   - Proper form labeling
   - Error announcements for screen readers
   - Keyboard navigation support

# Test Strategy:
Test the component with:
- Snapshot tests for visual regression
- Form submission tests with different player counts
- Validation tests for required fields
- Loading state display tests
- Error state display tests
- Form reset functionality tests
- Accessibility tests (form labeling, keyboard usage)
- Test with React Testing Library and Storybook
