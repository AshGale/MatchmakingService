# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Database Indexes
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create performance indexes on the database tables to optimize query performance for common operations.
# Details:
Implement the following indexes:
1. Index on lobbies.status for filtering queries when searching lobbies by status
2. Index on players.session_id for quick session lookups
3. Composite index on players (lobby_id, join_order) for efficient turn management

For each index:
- Determine appropriate index type (B-tree, hash, etc.)
- Consider partial indexes if applicable
- Document the purpose of each index
- Ensure indexes are named consistently following project conventions

# Test Strategy:
Perform the following tests:
- Query execution plan analysis to verify indexes are being used
- Performance benchmarks comparing query times with and without indexes
- Load testing with large datasets to verify index efficiency
- Verify index size and overhead is acceptable

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and identify required index types [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze database query patterns and identify the appropriate index types needed (B-tree, hash, GIN, GiST, etc.) based on the database system being used and query workload patterns.
### Details:
Review existing query performance, identify slow queries, analyze predicates and sort operations, and determine which columns would benefit from indexing. Document findings including index types supported by your database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).

## 2. Implement and test indexes [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create the identified indexes in development environment and measure performance improvements for each index type.
### Details:
For each index type: write CREATE INDEX statements, implement in dev environment, run before/after performance tests, document query execution time improvements, and identify any negative impacts on write operations. Include implementation of single-column, composite, and specialized indexes as needed.

## 3. Document and deploy indexes to production [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for all implemented indexes and deploy to production following change management procedures.
### Details:
Document each index with its purpose, structure, expected performance impact, and maintenance requirements. Create deployment scripts with rollback plans. Schedule deployment during low-traffic periods and monitor system performance after implementation. Update application documentation with new indexing strategy.
