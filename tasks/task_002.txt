# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Database Indexes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create performance indexes on the database tables to optimize query performance for common operations.
# Details:
Implement the following indexes:
1. Index on lobbies.status for filtering queries when searching lobbies by status
2. Index on players.session_id for quick session lookups
3. Composite index on players (lobby_id, join_order) for efficient turn management

For each index:
- Determine appropriate index type (B-tree, hash, etc.)
- Consider partial indexes if applicable
- Document the purpose of each index
- Ensure indexes are named consistently following project conventions

# Test Strategy:
Perform the following tests:
- Query execution plan analysis to verify indexes are being used
- Performance benchmarks comparing query times with and without indexes
- Load testing with large datasets to verify index efficiency
- Verify index size and overhead is acceptable
