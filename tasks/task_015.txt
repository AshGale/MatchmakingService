# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement FilterBar UI Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a component for filtering lobbies by status with active state indication and count badges.
# Details:
Implement the FilterBar component with:

1. Props interface:
   ```typescript
   interface FilterBarProps {
     activeFilter: string; // 'all', 'waiting', 'active', 'finished'
     onFilterChange: (filter: string) => void;
     counts: {
       all: number;
       waiting: number;
       active: number;
       finished: number;
     };
   }
   ```

2. Visual elements:
   - Row of filter buttons/tabs
   - Active state indication for current filter
   - Count badge for each filter option
   - Consistent styling with other components

3. Responsive design:
   - Desktop: Horizontal button row
   - Mobile: Dropdown or scrollable horizontal list

4. Accessibility:
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - ARIA attributes for current selection
   - Focus management

Implement with appropriate event handlers for filter changes.

# Test Strategy:
Test the component with:
- Snapshot tests for visual regression
- Render tests with different active filters
- Interaction tests for filter selection
- Verify onFilterChange is called with correct parameter
- Verify count badges display correctly
- Responsive design tests
- Accessibility tests (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility)
- Test with React Testing Library and Storybook
