# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement QuickJoinButton UI Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a button component for quick-joining a lobby with loading and disabled states.
# Details:
Implement the QuickJoinButton component with:

1. Props interface:
   ```typescript
   interface QuickJoinButtonProps {
     onQuickJoin: () => void;
     loading?: boolean;
     disabled?: boolean;
     preferredPlayers?: number;
   }
   ```

2. Visual elements:
   - Prominent button with "Quick Join" text
   - Loading spinner during loading state
   - Visual indication for disabled state
   - Optional player count preference indicator

3. States:
   - Normal state (clickable)
   - Loading state (during join operation)
   - Disabled state (when quick join not available)
   - Hover/focus states

4. Accessibility:
   - Proper ARIA attributes
   - Loading state announcement
   - Disabled state handling

# Test Strategy:
Test the component with:
- Snapshot tests for visual regression
- Click handler tests
- Loading state display tests
- Disabled state behavior tests
- Verify onQuickJoin is called correctly
- Accessibility tests (keyboard usage, screen reader compatibility)
- Test with React Testing Library and Storybook
