# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement LobbyCard UI Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a reusable LobbyCard component for displaying lobby information with join functionality.
# Details:
Implement the LobbyCard component with:

1. Props interface:
   ```typescript
   interface LobbyCardProps {
     lobby: LobbyObject; // {id, status, player_count, max_players, created_at}
     onJoin: (lobbyId: string) => void;
     loading?: boolean;
     disabled?: boolean;
   }
   ```

2. Visual elements:
   - Card container with appropriate styling
   - Lobby status indicator with color coding
   - Player count display (e.g., "2/4 players")
   - Join button with loading state
   - Created time in relative format (e.g., "5 minutes ago")

3. Responsive design:
   - Desktop: Grid layout with fixed width
   - Mobile: Full width cards in vertical stack
   - Appropriate spacing and typography

4. States:
   - Normal state
   - Loading state (during join operation)
   - Disabled state (when join not possible)
   - Hover/focus states for interactive elements

Use modern CSS approaches (CSS-in-JS, CSS modules, or styled components).

# Test Strategy:
Test the component with:
- Snapshot tests for visual regression
- Render tests with different prop combinations
- Interaction tests for join button clicks
- Loading state display tests
- Responsive design tests at different viewport sizes
- Accessibility tests (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility)
- Test with React Testing Library and Storybook
