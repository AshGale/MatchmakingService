# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Docker Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Docker and Docker Compose for the match-making server deployment on Windows 10
# Details:
Create Docker Compose configuration with services for Node.js application server, PostgreSQL database, and Caddy reverse proxy. Configure appropriate network settings, volume mappings for data persistence, and environment variables. Ensure the setup works with standard user privileges on Windows 10.

Docker Compose file structure:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: ./app
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_PORT=5432
      - DB_NAME=matchmaking
      - DB_USER=appuser
      - DB_PASSWORD=<password>
      - JWT_SECRET=<secret>
    volumes:
      - ./app:/usr/src/app
    restart: unless-stopped

  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=appuser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password>
      - POSTGRES_DB=matchmaking
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped

  caddy:
    image: caddy:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config
    depends_on:
      - app
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  postgres_data:
  caddy_data:
  caddy_config:
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify Docker Compose setup by running 'docker-compose up' and confirming all containers start successfully. Test network connectivity between containers. Verify volume persistence by restarting containers and checking data retention. Ensure the setup works with standard user privileges on Windows 10.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Docker on Windows 10 [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Download Docker Desktop for Windows 10, run the installer, enable required features (such as Hyper-V or WSL 2), and complete the initial configuration. Ensure the user is added to the 'docker-users' group and verify Docker is running.
### Details:
Follow official Docker Desktop installation steps, including system prerequisites (64-bit processor, 4GB RAM), and post-installation user group configuration. Restart the system if necessary.[1][5]

## 2. Create Dockerfile for Node.js Application [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Write a Dockerfile that defines the build steps for the Node.js application, including setting the base image, copying source code, installing dependencies, and specifying the start command.
### Details:
Ensure the Dockerfile exposes the correct ports and uses best practices for Node.js containerization (e.g., multi-stage builds, .dockerignore).

## 3. Configure PostgreSQL Database Service [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up a PostgreSQL service for Docker, including environment variables for user, password, and database name, and configure persistent storage using Docker volumes.
### Details:
Prepare a section for PostgreSQL in the Docker Compose file, ensuring secure credentials and data persistence.

## 4. Set Up Caddy Reverse Proxy Service [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Configure a Caddy service in Docker to act as a reverse proxy for the Node.js application, including necessary Caddyfile configuration and port mappings.
### Details:
Write a Caddyfile to route HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the Node.js container, and ensure the Caddy service is included in Docker Compose.

## 5. Configure Docker Compose Networks and Volumes [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Define Docker Compose networks for inter-service communication and volumes for persistent data storage, ensuring all services are correctly connected and data is retained across container restarts.
### Details:
Edit the docker-compose.yml file to specify named networks and volumes, and verify that all services (Node.js, PostgreSQL, Caddy) are properly networked and have access to required volumes.
