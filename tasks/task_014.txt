# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement LobbyList UI Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13, 19, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a component for displaying a grid of LobbyCard components with loading and error states.
# Details:
Implement the LobbyList component with:

1. Props interface:
   ```typescript
   interface LobbyListProps {
     lobbies: LobbyObject[];
     onJoinLobby: (lobbyId: string) => void;
     loading?: boolean;
     error?: string;
   }
   ```

2. Visual elements:
   - Container for lobby cards grid
   - Loading skeleton placeholders during loading
   - Empty state message when no lobbies available
   - Error message display when error occurs

3. Responsive design:
   - Desktop: Grid layout (3-4 cards per row)
   - Tablet: 2 cards per row
   - Mobile: Single column layout

4. States:
   - Normal state with lobby cards
   - Loading state with skeletons
   - Empty state with message
   - Error state with message and retry option

Use the LobbyCard component for each lobby item.

# Test Strategy:
Test the component with:
- Snapshot tests for visual regression
- Render tests with different data sets (empty, few items, many items)
- Loading state display tests
- Error state display tests
- Responsive layout tests at different breakpoints
- Verify correct props are passed to child LobbyCard components
- Test with React Testing Library and Storybook
