# Task ID: 21
# Title: Create TypeScript Declarations for CSS Modules
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a declaration file (src/types/css.d.ts) that properly defines TypeScript type definitions for CSS modules to prevent import errors when using CSS and CSS module files in the project.
# Details:
This task involves creating a TypeScript declaration file to properly handle CSS module imports:

1. Create a new directory `src/types` if it doesn't already exist
2. Create a new file `src/types/css.d.ts` with the following content:
   ```typescript
   declare module '*.css' {
     const classes: { [key: string]: string };
     export default classes;
   }
   
   declare module '*.module.css' {
     const classes: { [key: string]: string };
     export default classes;
   }
   ```
3. This declaration tells TypeScript that when importing a CSS file, it should expect an object with string keys and string values, which represents the CSS class names.
4. Ensure the declaration file is included in the TypeScript compilation by verifying it's within the `include` paths in `tsconfig.json`.
5. If needed, update the `tsconfig.json` file to include the new types directory:
   ```json
   {
     "include": ["src/**/*", "src/types/*.d.ts"]
   }
   ```
6. Document this approach in the project documentation so other developers understand how CSS modules are typed in the project.

Consider also adding declarations for other style formats if used in the project (e.g., *.scss, *.sass, *.less).

# Test Strategy:
To verify this task has been completed successfully:

1. **Static verification**:
   - Confirm the `src/types/css.d.ts` file exists with the correct content
   - Verify the file is properly included in the TypeScript compilation path

2. **Functional testing**:
   - Create a test component that imports a CSS module: `import styles from './TestComponent.module.css'`
   - Verify that TypeScript doesn't show any import errors in the IDE
   - Verify that the component can access class names via the imported object: `className={styles.container}`
   - Run TypeScript compilation (`tsc --noEmit`) and confirm no errors are reported

3. **Integration testing**:
   - Import and use the test component in an existing page/component
   - Verify that the application builds successfully without TypeScript errors
   - Verify that the styles are correctly applied when the application runs

4. **Documentation check**:
   - Ensure the approach is documented in the project's README or developer documentation
   - Add a comment at the top of the css.d.ts file explaining its purpose for future developers
