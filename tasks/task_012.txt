# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Business Logic Modules
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create isolated business logic classes for lobby management, matchmaking, and session management with mock data interfaces.
# Details:
Implement the following business logic modules:

1. LobbyManager class:
   - Methods for creating, retrieving, and updating lobbies
   - Capacity validation logic
   - Status transition validation
   - Player addition/removal logic

2. MatchmakingEngine class:
   - Quick-join algorithm implementation
   - Lobby selection based on preferences
   - Fallback to new lobby creation
   - Optimized matching strategies

3. SessionManager class:
   - Session validation methods
   - Session cleanup for inactive sessions
   - Session tracking and management

Each class should:
- Use dependency injection for data access
- Work with mock data interfaces initially
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Be fully unit-testable in isolation
- Follow SOLID principles

# Test Strategy:
Test each module with:
- Unit tests for all public methods
- Mock dependencies to isolate testing
- Test happy paths and error scenarios
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Verify business rules are correctly enforced
- Test with various mock data configurations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement LobbyManager class with core functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the LobbyManager class that handles player lobbies, including methods for creating, joining, and leaving lobbies.
### Details:
Implement the following methods:
- createLobby(playerId, settings): Creates a new lobby with the specified player as host
- joinLobby(playerId, lobbyId): Adds a player to an existing lobby
- leaveLobby(playerId, lobbyId): Removes a player from a lobby
- getLobbyInfo(lobbyId): Returns details about a specific lobby
- listAvailableLobbies(): Returns all open lobbies

Ensure proper error handling for cases like lobby not found, player already in lobby, etc. Write comprehensive unit tests for each method.

## 2. Implement MatchmakingEngine class with matchmaking algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create the MatchmakingEngine class that handles player matching based on skill levels, preferences, and other criteria.
### Details:
Implement the following methods:
- findMatch(playerId, criteria): Finds suitable matches based on player criteria
- createQueue(queueType): Creates a new matchmaking queue
- addToQueue(playerId, queueId): Adds a player to a matchmaking queue
- removeFromQueue(playerId): Removes a player from any queues
- processQueue(queueId): Processes a queue to create matches

Implement at least one matchmaking algorithm (e.g., ELO-based, skill-based). Include timeout handling for long queue times. Write unit tests that verify the matchmaking logic works correctly with various player combinations.

## 3. Implement SessionManager class with session handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Create the SessionManager class that manages active game sessions, including creation, monitoring, and cleanup.
### Details:
Implement the following methods:
- createSession(players, settings): Creates a new game session
- endSession(sessionId): Properly terminates a session
- getSessionStatus(sessionId): Returns the current status of a session
- listActiveSessions(): Returns all currently active sessions
- updateSessionState(sessionId, newState): Updates the state of an ongoing session

Ensure the SessionManager can handle session timeouts and disconnections gracefully. Implement proper cleanup of resources when sessions end. Write integration tests that verify the interaction between LobbyManager, MatchmakingEngine, and SessionManager.
